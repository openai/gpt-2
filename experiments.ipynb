We'll be able to choose between the small (**117M** parameters) , medium (**345M** parameters), large (**774M** parameters) and XL versions (**1.5B** parameters) version of GPT-2.  \n",

        "According to the authors, the GPT-2 algorithm was trained on the task of *language modeling*--- which tests a program's ability to predict the next word in a given sentence--by ingesting huge numbers of articles, blogs, and websites. By using just this data it achieved state-of-the-art scores on a number of unseen language tests, an achievement known as *zero-shot learning.* It can also perform other writing-related tasks, like translating text from one language to another, summarizing long articles, and answering trivia questions.\n"

This is problematic as individuals and organizations, including state and non-state actors, can use, both maliciously or just for convenience, such bots to pose as humans, including themselves, on message boards, dating sites, micro-broadcasting sites (e.g., Twitter and Instagram), and even between individual and group private text threads.  This is problematic as it undermines the trust individuals have in such forums and increases public disdain for technologies that may otherwise serve humanity.  The issue becomes how can we produce a kind of “proof of humaness” such that a party may rely on the humanness of the counterparty.  It seems one such adaptive approach may be for humans to change language faster than bots can mimic it--a kind of arms race between language use of humans and bots.\n",

            "Model prompt >>> NLP and other technologies are progressing quickly such that in the relatively near future it will be hard for humans to tell if they are talking with other humans or bots online.  This is problematic as individuals and organizations, including state and non-state actors, can use, both maliciously or just for convenience, such bots to pose as humans, including themselves, on message boards, dating sites, micro-broadcasting sites (e.g., Twitter and Instagram), and even between individual and group private text threads.  This is problematic as it undermines the trust individuals have in such forums and increases public disdain for technologies that may otherwise serve humanity.  The issue becomes how can we produce a kind of “proof of humaness” such that a party may rely on the humanness of the counterparty.  It seems one such adaptive approach may be for humans to change language faster than bots can mimic it--a kind of arms race between language use of humans and bots. The assumption is that much of the state of the art in the near term will be trained on historical language data that is dated such that humans have a sufficient window of time to use “modern slang” consisting purposely misspelled words to connote emphasis (e,.g., niiiice), emojis, jifs, and other relatively new forms of language/expression, but in a much more frequent and ambiguous way so that humans can signal to other humans they are real.  While use of such language/expression is already occurring as a socio-cultural phenomena, to date it has not been used as a way of proving humanness. An alternative or in conjunction with the above such modern slang may be used to train classifiers to help detect whether a bot is being used. TL;DR: \n",
