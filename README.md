# gpt-2

Code from the paper ["Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners"](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language-models.pdf).

We have currently released small (117M parameter) and medium (345M parameter) versions of GPT-2.  While we have not released the larger models, we have [released a dataset](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2-output-dataset) for researchers to study their behaviors.

See more details in our [blog post](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/).

## Usage

This repository is meant to be a starting point for researchers and engineers to experiment with GPT-2.

### Some caveats

- GPT-2 models' robustness and worst case behaviors are not well-understood.  As with any machine-learned model, carefully evaluate GPT-2 for your use case, especially if used without fine-tuning or in safety-critical applications where reliability is important.
- The dataset our GPT-2 models were trained on contains many texts with [biases](https://twitter.com/TomerUllman/status/1101485289720242177) and factual inaccuracies, and thus GPT-2 models are likely to be biased and inaccurate as well.
- To avoid having samples mistaken as human-written, we recommend clearly labeling samples as synthetic before wide dissemination.  Our models are often incoherent or inaccurate in subtle ways, which takes more than a quick read for a human to notice.

### Work with us

Please [let us know](mailto:languagequestions@openai.com) if you’re doing interesting research with or working on applications of GPT-2!  We’re especially interested in hearing from and potentially working with those who are studying
- Potential malicious use cases and defenses against them (e.g. the detectability of synthetic text)
- The extent of problematic content (e.g. bias) being baked into the models and effective mitigations

## Future work

We may release code for evaluating the models on various benchmarks.

We are still considering release of the larger models.
