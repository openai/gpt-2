    Run the sample_model
    :model_name=117M : String, which model to use
    :seed=None : Integer seed for random number generators, fix seed to
     reproduce results
    :nsamples=1 : Number of samples to return, if 0, continues to
     generate samples indefinately.
    :batch_size=1 : Number of batches (only affects speed/memory).
    :length=None : Number of tokens in generated text, if None (default), is
     determined by model hyperparameters
    :temperature=1 : Float value controlling randomness in boltzmann
     distribution. Lower temperature results in less random completions. As the
     temperature approaches zero, the model will become deterministic and
     repetitive. Higher temperature results in more random completions.
    :top_k=0 : Integer value controlling diversity. 1 means only 1 word is
     considered for each step (token), resulting in deterministic completions,
     while 40 means 40 words are considered at each step. 0 (default) is a
     special setting meaning no restrictions. 40 generally is a good value.
    :top_p=0.0 : Float value controlling diversity. Implements nucleus sampling,
     overriding top_k if set to a value > 0. A good setting is 0.9.
    :input_file=None : Input file as a path to a text file with each line 
     containing context string for the model to generate upon. Must be provided
    :output_file="conditional_sample_output.txt" : Outut file as an optional
     file path for the output samples. One sample saved per line.
